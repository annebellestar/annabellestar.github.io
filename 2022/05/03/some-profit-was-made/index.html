<p>‘You can make money a lot of ways, but sports gambling ain’t it.’ - somebody, somewhere.</p>
<p>My team of three began with $1500 (fictional) dollars to bet on NBA teams and see if we could make any sort of net profit. Well, fortunately for us, we went all in our last bet and made a grand total of … wait for it … $149.20 dollars. Keep in mind, we bet approximately $200 dollars every day for two weeks and only ended up with less profit than we bet.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: don’t bet on sports unless you have thousands to spare.</p>
<p>Anyways, let’s get into the premise for what we based our predictions on. We made a model that basically spit out results. We input different factors into a code, and then we used those factors to determine who would win. However, to be perfectly honest, we pretty much abandoned our model at the end of the betting.</p>
<p>In our model, we used these factors:
Team turnovers.
Rolling free throw factor.
Rolling offensive efficiency.</p>
<p>We used logistic regression.</p>
<p>As far as our model went, it usually predicted the predicted winners as … the winners. However, the issue was, playoffs are tricky. Teams have a nasty tendency to go on hot streaks, random players get injured, random ones get hot, and there’s always that stupid favoured team that just doesn’t win (<em>cough Utah</em>).</p>
<p>That was the biggest reason we abandoned our model. If betting took place nearer to the middle and/or beginning half of the season, we’d have probably stuck a bit closer to our model. However, since it was the end of the season plus playoffs, our model kind of got yeeted aside in favour of day-to-day predictions and that dash of luck.</p>
<p>That, and we occasionally forgot about betting, so we sometimes slammed money down as quickly as possible and hoped a team would pick up the proverbial dollars for us. Besides just chatting on our group chat, we didn’t do a lot of in-person chatting since everyone (myself included) found the excuse to be conveniently busy whenever we needed to have a betting conversation.</p>
<p>Really, it didn’t turn out as bad as it could be. And the only reason we actually made a profit was because we shoved tons of money in and won that last bet: we got lucky. Luck. That is … the deciding factor. You can spend hours trying to figure out the best model with the precise statistics or the X factor, but when push comes to shove, sports isn’t all about statistics, there’s a bit of luck involved as well.</p>
<p>That being said, perhaps there’s a factor that can determine luck. I wouldn’t know what that factor is … maybe something that could determine the margin of points when it came to losing (for example, if a team only lost games by a few points, maybe their luck factor is higher; whereas losing by a lot of points would make that factor decrease). Maybe a luck factor could be devised by taking statistics from individual players and creating that into something lucky.</p>
<p>I also think there should be a way for the code to figure out who’s playing and who’s not day-to-day. If each player had an assigned value to the team then maybe that could determine who would win. Not only this, but if the code could actively pull statistics and assign the players new ratings each game then it could even factor in the new players who get hot during the playoffs.</p>
<p>All of that would probably take a complex algorithm, and probably by the end of it you’d figure out it still wouldn’t work. All in all, sports betting is an activity that’ll probably suck the joy out of actually enjoying sports … I’d bet on that.</p>
