    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Hello there. If you participated in the NCAA tournament this year, chances are, you <em>probably</em> didn&rsquo;t choose St Mary&rsquo;s to win it all. In fact, I bet most people don&rsquo;t even know where St Mary&rsquo;s is located. I sure as heck didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Alas, St Mary&rsquo;s is who I inevitably picked to win it all for this year&rsquo;s 2022 NCAA Bracket Challenge. Yes, the one everyone submits to ESPN. The one that actually has prize money (and horrendous bragging rights) attached.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re wondering why I picked St Mary&rsquo;s to win it all (over Seton Hall, no less), do keep reading.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a few reasons why you might think I picked St Mary&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t follow NCAA basketball.</p>
<p>I went to St Mary&rsquo;s for education.</p>
<p>I believe in miracles.</p>
<p>I was using a computational algorithm based on advanced statistics that somehow spit out St Mary&rsquo;s as your 2022 NCAA Men&rsquo;s Basketball Champion.</p>
<p>If you guess the last one, hooray. Have an air high-five.</p>
<p>So basically, I used a coding programme to run an algorithm and statistics-based formula that I thought would correctly predict the NCAA tourney winner this year.</p>
<p>I ran three different factors:</p>
<p>• PIE, or Player Impact Efficiency (this is a statistic I stole from the NBA that measures &hellip; a lot of stuff. The formula for PIE is complicated and long)</p>
<p>This statistic analyses what % of certain calculated game events that team achieve (these statistics are the traditional statistics of Points, Rebounds, Assists, and Turnover Percentage). If their PIE is above 50% then they have a good chance of winning the game. The formula for this statistic is as follows: (PTS + FGM + FTM - FGA - FTA + DREB + (.5 * OREB) + AST + STL + (.5 * BLK) - PF - TO) / (GmPTS + GmFGM + GmFTM - GmFGA - GmFTA + GmDREB + (.5 * GmOREB) + GmAST + GmSTL + (.5 * GmBLK) - GmPF - GmTO).</p>
<p>• Adjusted Offense (a statistic that measures how many points per 100 possessions)</p>
<p>• Adjusted Defense (a statistic that measures how many points against per 100 possesions by the opponent)</p>
<p>You can take a look at my code below:</p>
<p>teamstats &lt;- teamgames %&gt;%
group_by(team_short_display_name, season) %&gt;%
arrange(game_date) %&gt;%
mutate(
team_score = ((field_goals_made-three_point_field_goals_made) * 2) + (three_point_field_goals_made*3) + free_throws_made,
team_pie_numerator = (team_score + field_goals_made + free_throws_made - field_goals_attempted - free_throws_attempted + defensive_rebounds + (.5 * offensive_rebounds) + assists + steals + (.5 * blocks) - fouls - turnovers),
) %&gt;% ungroup() %&gt;% rename(
team_adj_o = adj_o,
team_adj_d = adj_d
)</p>
<p>Turns out these weren&rsquo;t the best factors to use when calculating NCAA matchups (or at least the ones this year).</p>
<p>I think where I mostly went wrong was the PIE statistic.</p>
<p>Why?
The NCAA is not the NBA.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the formula, I believe that PIE is a statistic that really works with teams that either score a lot, have a small margin of error, and have a more consistent play.</p>
<p>I also failed to add in any of the traditional statistic such as Rebounds, Field Goal Percentage, and Shooting Percentage.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not much to say why my brackets performed the way they did, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s just how the ball rolls sometimes.</p>
<p>Maybe next year I&rsquo;ll find a way to tweak my predictions and win it all.</p>
