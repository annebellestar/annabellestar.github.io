      <description>‘You can make money a lot of ways, but sports gambling ain’t it.’ - somebody, somewhere.
My team of three began with $1500 (fictional) dollars to bet on NBA teams and see if we could make any sort of net profit. Well, fortunately for us, we went all in our last bet and made a grand total of … wait for it … $149.20 dollars. Keep in mind, we bet approximately $200 dollars every day for two weeks and only ended up with less profit than we bet.</description>

      <description>Hello there. If you participated in the NCAA tournament this year, chances are, you probably didn&amp;rsquo;t choose St Mary&amp;rsquo;s to win it all. In fact, I bet most people don&amp;rsquo;t even know where St Mary&amp;rsquo;s is located. I sure as heck didn&amp;rsquo;t.
Alas, St Mary&amp;rsquo;s is who I inevitably picked to win it all for this year&amp;rsquo;s 2022 NCAA Bracket Challenge. Yes, the one everyone submits to ESPN. The one that actually has prize money (and horrendous bragging rights) attached.</description>
